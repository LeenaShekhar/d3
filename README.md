HTML- It is used to structure content for web browsers-- how you decide what goes where on your page. 

DOM- Your HTML has a hierarchical structure just like your family., parents and children. Web browserrs parse this structure to make sense of the content of a page.

CSS- It is used to style your web page-- aesthetics: color, fonts, margins etc.

JavaScript- Dynamic scripting language so that you can instruct the browser to do cool things without reloading the entire page.

SVG- THis is a text based image format--- you can specify image using tags like the ones in HTML. This is what ou use when you want to have an image, which neer loses quality. 

Developer tools- I would suggest to use Chrome. OPen your HTML page in your browser, right click, and choose Inspct Element-- you will see many cool section including the current state of your DOM. Explore it-- console is going to be your buddy!
